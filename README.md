**Overview:**

Total Donation Amount: 1.033 billion VND, representing the total amount collected from the campaign.

Number of Transactions: 139 individual donation transactions, indicating the level of community participation.

Most Common Donation Amount: 100K VND, the most popular amount donated during the campaign, reflecting the preference for moderate contributions from individuals.

Largest Donation Amount: 1 billion VND, indicating a significant contribution, likely from a corporate donor.

Smallest Donation Amount: 1,000 VND, a symbolic donation, showing that even small contributions are meaningful.

**Donation Distribution by Quantity:**

The pie chart shows that the majority of donors are individuals, accounting for 136 transactions (97.84% of the total).

Corporations and collective groups contributed very few transactions (2 and 1, respectively), but their financial impact is significant.

**Donation Distribution by Amount:**

Although the number of corporate transactions is small, they contributed the largest portion of the total amount (1 billion VND).

Individual contributions, while more numerous, represent a smaller total value compared to those from corporations.

This illustrates the substantial financial impact of corporate donations, despite their fewer transactions.

**Amount Segment:**

The most popular donation segment is 50K – 200K VND, with 100 transactions contributing a total of 9.2 million VND.

Notably, there was only one transaction in the 100 million+ VND range, but it contributed 1 billion VND, highlighting the significance of large contributions.

Smaller donations, such as those below 50K VND, although few, still add to the total amount.

**Transaction List:**

This table provides transparent information with detailed records of individual transactions, including the date, amount donated, and brief descriptions for each contribution.

Users can track the origin and purpose of the donations.

The largest transaction was from Katinat's commitment to support the aftermath of the storm, as promised earlier.

**Key Insights:**
Large Contributions Are Crucial: While many individual donations are small, large contributions, especially from corporations, have had a significant impact on the total amount raised.

Symbolic Donations Hold Meaning: The campaign encourages participation at all levels, even if it’s a small symbolic donation of 1,000 VND, illustrating that every contribution matters.

Popular Donation Range: The most common donation amount falls within the 50K - 200K VND range, reflecting widespread participation and commitment from individuals.

Corporate Commitment Fulfilled: The largest donation represents Katinat's prior commitment to support disaster recovery, highlighting their important role in disaster relief efforts.

Although the campaign may not have garnered widespread public support, it is clear that Katinat's marketing efforts have had a positive impact on society, with 33 million VND raised to support affected families in flood-affected areas. Furthermore, from a customer engagement perspective, Katinat has successfully increased brand awareness through this campaign.
